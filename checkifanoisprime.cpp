/*Check if a Number is Prime
Objective
Check if a given number n is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 To determine if a number is prime, iterate from 2 to âˆšn and check if n is divisible by any number in this range. If it is divisible, it is not a prime number; otherwise, it is a prime.*/
